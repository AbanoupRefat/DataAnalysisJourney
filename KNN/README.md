## Project Overview

The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is a simple, yet powerful, supervised learning method used for classification tasks. This project focuses on building a k-NN model to classify data points based on their features. The steps involved include data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named `Data.csv`. It contains various features that are used to classify data points. Some of the key attributes include:

- `footfall`: The number of people or objects passing by the machine.
- `tempMode`: The temperature mode or measurement.
- (Add other attributes as needed based on the dataset).

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Loading all necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
2. **Loading Dataset**: Reading the dataset from the CSV file and displaying initial records to understand the structure.
3. **Data Exploration**: Checking the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and getting a summary of the data types and memory usage.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the data to understand distributions and relationships.
5. **Modeling with k-NN**: Implementing the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to train the model on the dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Ensure that `Data.csv` is present in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `Knn.ipynb`.
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the data analysis and modeling steps.

## Results

The results of the project include the accuracy and performance metrics of the k-NN model. These results help in understanding how well the model performs on the given dataset.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification tasks. By following the steps outlined, you can understand how to preprocess data, visualize relationships, and build a k-NN model to classify data points effectively.

Feel free to experiment with different parameters and configurations to improve the model's performance.
