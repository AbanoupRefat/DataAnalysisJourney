# Hotel Bookings Analysis and Visual Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive dashboard for analyzing hotel bookings, focusing on key performance indicators and visual summaries of booking trends, cancellations, and customer types. The dashboard is created using **Microsoft Power BI** and offers various insights into hotel performance across multiple metrics.

## Overview

The dashboard includes several interactive charts and visualizations that provide insights into hotel booking patterns. The key metrics and visualizations presented are:

- **Total Adults & Children**: Displays the total number of adults and children in the bookings.
- **Cancellations by Year**: A line chart showing the number of canceled bookings by year.
- **Cancellations by Country**: A pie chart showing the percentage of canceled bookings by country.
- **Sum of Adults & Children by Hotel**: A bar chart comparing the number of adults and children in bookings for different hotel types (City Hotel, Resort Hotel).
- **Repeated Guests by Country**: A treemap showing the distribution of repeated guests by country.
- **Customer Type by Deposit and Customer Type**: A bar chart that breaks down customer types (Contract, Group, Transient) by the deposit type (No Deposit, Non-Refundable, Refundable).
- **Distribution Channel by Deposit Type & Country**: A stacked bar chart that visualizes the distribution of deposit types (No Deposit, Non-Refundable, Refundable) across different countries and distribution channels.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project includes hotel booking information, with fields such as:
- Number of adults and children
- Country of origin
- Customer type (e.g., transient, contract, group)
- Hotel type (City Hotel, Resort Hotel)
- Deposit type (No deposit, refundable, non-refundable)
- Whether a guest is a repeated customer
- Cancellations, among other key variables

## Key Insights

1. **Booking Demographics**:
   - The total number of adults is significantly higher than the number of children.
   
2. **Cancellation Trends**:
   - There has been a noticeable increase in cancellations over the years.
   - Certain countries have a higher rate of cancellations, especially large contributors like Portugal (PRT), Great Britain (GBR), and France (FRA).

3. **Hotel Preferences**:
   - City hotels seem to have a larger share of bookings compared to resort hotels.
   
4. **Customer Type Breakdown**:
   - Most customers are transient, with various deposit types being used depending on the country and the booking source.

## How to Use

1. Open the **Power BI file** (.pbix) and explore the visualizations.
2. Filters on the right allow users to filter the data by country, customer type, deposit type, and whether the guest is a repeated visitor.
3. The visualizations are interactive, and users can click on different parts of the charts to cross-filter the data.

## Requirements

- **Microsoft Power BI Desktop** is required to view and interact with the dashboard.
- A basic understanding of Power BI and data visualization concepts is recommended to make full use of the interactive features.
