# Logistic Regression Model for Prediction

This project demonstrates how to build and use a logistic regression model for prediction. It includes steps for model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Structure

- **ipython-input-14-e7ea1b7e797d**: Contains code for training a logistic regression model using sklearn.
- **ipython-input-15-e7ea1b7e797d**: Evaluates the trained model using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **ipython-input-17-e7ea1b7e797d**: Visualizes the confusion matrix of the model.
- **ipython-input-18-e7ea1b7e797d**: Plots the logistic regression curve to visualize the relationship between feature values and predicted probabilities.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- pandas (if using DataFrames)

## Installation

Install the required packages:

```bash
!pip install scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your data**: Ensure your data is in a suitable format (e.g., NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames) and split into training and testing sets (`X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, `y_test`).

2. **Execute the code**: Run the Python scripts in the provided order to train the model, evaluate its performance, and generate visualizations.

## Notes

- Make sure the input data for prediction (`x_range`) has the same number of features as the training data (`X_train`).
- Adjust the code and parameters as needed to fit your specific dataset and prediction task.
